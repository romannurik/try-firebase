A little experiment in quickly trying out Firebase with the local emulators suite.

# Known issues (since this is just an experiment!):

- It's all super delicate... if anything doesn't go right, ruh roh
- Requires `firebase-tools` be already installed (obviously a blocking bug)
- Fails pretty bad when your ports are busy (both CRA and emulators have hard-coded ports)
